					<h2 class="header-in-text">Hello! I'm Devin Warrick,</h2>
					<p>
						a Staff Software Engineer based in Dallas, Texas,
						with a proven track record of building robust and scalable full-stack applications.
					</p>
					<p>
						My journey into technology is rooted in a creative background in music composition —
						a field that honed my ability to see both the intricate details as well as the larger architectural picture.
						I apply that same creative discipline and structural thinking to software engineering,
						transforming complex problems into elegant, high-performing solutions.
					</p>
					<p>
						As a staff engineer, I specialize in architecting and delivering impactful features for web and mobile platforms.
						I thrive on leading technical initiatives, mentoring fellow engineers, and leveraging my expertise across the stack to build exceptional user experiences.
